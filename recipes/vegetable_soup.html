  <h1>Vegetable Beef Soup (Fall apart beef!)</h1>

  <p>A hearty Vegetable Beef Soup with melt-in-your-mouth slow cooked chunks of beef, potato and vegetables simmered in a herb infused savoury broth. You’ll love how the broth of this beef soup recipe is slightly thickened so it’s like gravy and <b>has extra flavour from a secret ingredient!</b></p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul><li>1.5 tbsp olive oil</li>
<li>500g/1 lb stewing beef </li>
<li>1/2 tsp salt and pepper</li>
<li>1 onion</li>
<li>3 garlic</li>
<li>2 celery </li>
<li>3 carrots</li>
<li>4 tbsp flour</li>
<li>2 1/2 cups (625ml) beef broth/stock</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups (375ml) dry red wine, Guinness beer or stout (Note 2)
  ▢1.5 cups (375ml) water</li>
<li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
<li>2 bay leaves</li>
<li>1 tsp thyme dried</li>
<li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
<li>2 potatoes</li>
<li>1 tbsp (15g) butter or oil</li></ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol><li>Heat 1 tbsp oil until very hot in a large, heavy based pot over high heat.</li>
<li>Pat beef dry with paper towels, then sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Brown beef aggressively in 2 or 3 batches, adding more oil if needed. Remove browned beef into a bowl.</li>
<li>If pot looks dry, add a touch more oil.</li>
<li>Add garlic and onion, cook for 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Add carrot and celery, cook for 2 minutes or until onion is translucent.</li>
<li>Stir in flour, then slowly pour in beef broth while constantly stirring.</li>
<li>Add beer, water, tomato paste, bay leaves and thyme, stir well. Then add the beef back in.</li>
<li>Cover, adjust heat to medium low so it's bubbling gently. Simmer 1 hr 15 min or until beef is pretty tender.</li>
<li>Add potatoes and peas, simmer for a further 20 minutes without the lid. Add cooked mushrooms in the last 5 minutes.</li>
<li>The soup is ready when the potatoes are cooked and beef is very tender </li>
<li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste (I like lots of pepper in this!).</li>
<li>Ladle into bowls. Sprinkle with parsley and serve with crusty bread if desired. Try quick Cheesy Garlic Bread or super easy Irish Soda Bread!</li>
<li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes until browned. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li></ol>
